## About Me

Iâ€™m an aspiring **AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in engineering and a passion for building intelligent systems. After more than a decade in faÃ§ade design, I transitioned into tech, combining analytical thinking with modern tools to solve real-world problems.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s in Computer Science** (Cloud & AI), completing a **Data Science bootcamp**, and expanding my knowledge through programs by **Google** on **Generative AI, LLMs**, and **AI project delivery**. Iâ€™m also active in the **Berlin AI/Python community**, helping organize events through groups like PyLadies.

## Core Focus Areas

- **Machine Learning & AI:** Supervised & unsupervised learning, deep learning (CNNs, RNNs), NLP, LLMs  
- **Generative AI:** Prompt engineering, GenAI agents, domain-specific LLMs 
- **Cloud & Data Infrastructure:** Google Cloud, Vertex AI, BigQuery, distributed data systems  
- **Key Tools & Languages:** Python, SQL, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Jupyter, Git  

> Iâ€™ve completed programs by **Google**, **infoShare Academy**, and others focused on applied AI, cloud-based deployment, and modern tooling for developers and business integration.
