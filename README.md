## About Me

Iâ€™m an aspiring **AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in engineering and a passion for building intelligent systems. After more than a decade in faÃ§ade design, I transitioned into tech, combining analytical thinking with modern tools to solve real-world problems.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s in Computer Science** (Cloud & AI), completing a **Data Science bootcamp**, and expanding my knowledge through programs by **Google** on **Generative AI, LLMs**, and **AI project delivery**. Iâ€™m also active in the **Berlin AI/Python community**, helping organize events through groups like PyLadies.
