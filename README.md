**A lifelong learner** with a passion for **discovery**, **creativity**, and solving **meaningful problems**.

---

My journey hasnâ€™t exactly followed a straight line â€“ I went from **big construction projects** to diving into the world of **data**, **tech**, and **innovation**.

**Curiosity** has always been my compass, and Iâ€™ve never stopped chasing what excites me to **learn** and **build**.

Whether itâ€™s **designing something physical** or **creating a smart solution**, I love working where **logic meets creativity** and **real impact happens**.

---

Along the way, Iâ€™ve earned an **eMBA**, explored **AI**, and **embraced every challenge** that came with switching paths.

I believe in **constant growth** â€“ and in finding **simple answers to complex problems**.

---

### **Machine learning** ðŸ¤–, **AI**, **Space technology** ðŸš€?

Iâ€™m **all in**!

### Always learning, always exploring.



Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me watching **rocket launches**, exploring **nature**, or staying **active and on the move**

**Letâ€™s see where curiosity takes us next.**
