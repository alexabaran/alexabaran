## AI + Curiosity + Coffee â˜• = Me

---

Iâ€™m on a mission to turn good ideas into smart, ethical tech.
Still learning. Always curious. 
Fueled by data, questions, and good coffee.

**what I do...**

Iâ€™m exploring how to build thoughtful AI and user-centered digital products - combining my engineering background with curiosity, empathy, and a love for creative problem-solving.

**what I care about...**

Responsible AI thatâ€™s ethical, sustainable, and made for people - with care, not just code.

**where I come from...**

Over 10 years in the construction industry taught me structure, systems thinking, and how to lead complex projects.
Now Iâ€™m bringing that mindset into data, AI, and product design.

**what I believe...**

The best technology feels invisible - because it fits people, not the other way around.

**what I love...**

Big ideas. Simple tools. 
Nature hikes, dogs, and strong coffee.
